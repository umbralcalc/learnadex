# learnadex

The 'learnadex' builds on the capabilities and framework provided by the [stochadex package](https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex) to enable maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimisation, dynamical process emulation and approximate inference of generalised stochastic models.

## Need more context and documentation?

The design, development, implementation details behind and practical documentation for the 'learnadex' can all be found in **Part 2** of this very delightful book: [Diffusing Ideas](https://umbralcalc.github.io/diffusing-ideas/).
